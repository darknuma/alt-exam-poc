/*
 * how I solved is, to create a cte of succesful order, by using order table and events
 * table, which we join by customer id with customer tablein order to extract the item id
 * and quanitity, where the status of checkout is successful 
 * next is to know the total spent, by joing successful orders with products table
 * this gave the opportunity to do the calculation to find the amount spent. 
 * (problem I encountered was for successful orders, in the where clause, i tried
 * linking checkout status of event data to the order status, it was returning NULL
 * for all the data. I didn't even continue.
